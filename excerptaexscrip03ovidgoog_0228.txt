Α BOOK Ill.

Caunus was the son ol Agenor, king os Phoenicia. J u·
piter, having transformed himself into a bull, prevailed on
Europa, the sister of this prince, to get on his back, and
immediately plunging into the sea, he carried her across it
into Crete. Agenor, ignorant of the fate of his daugh-
ter and disconsolate at ber loss, ordered Cadmus to go in
ἡ search of Europa3 with a command not to return to Phoe-
, nicia till he had found her. The pursuit of Cadmus was
fruitless. He couldg hear no tidings of his sister, and not
daring to return to his native land without her, he resolved
to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, that he might
know iu what part of the earth to fix his abode.

’ The oracle directed him to follow a heifer‚ which wasde-
scribed to him, and whererer she should lie down, there to
build a city, and to call the country Boeotia. Cadmus soon
found the heifer‚ and put himself under her guidance3 she
at length lay down near the banks of the river Cephisus,
where he prepared to commence the city according to the
directions of the oracle. Here the present account begins.
The spot is a little north of Attica. Cadmus is supposed

brought with him the use of letters, and the worship of
