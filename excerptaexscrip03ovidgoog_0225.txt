source os this celebrated river, though it was for ages e sub·
ject of inquiry, remained unknown till a t'ew years since3
when the traveller Bruce is said to have discovered it. Itis
now ascertained that it takes its riae in Abyssinie, and ulier
flowing through hbex, N ubia, und Egypt, it emptiesitself by
seven mouths or channels into the Meditersneen see, near
tbe city Alexandria. The Nile annuallyorerflows its bunks

of Egyptis covered with its woters. This inundation is

the sun is vertioal in Ethiopia in the months of April and
May3 and though itis sometimes dangerous and desoleting
in its consequences when the rise os the waters is excessive,
it is in general attended with the most benefioiul effecta,
fertilizing tbe lands, and enriching the natives.
