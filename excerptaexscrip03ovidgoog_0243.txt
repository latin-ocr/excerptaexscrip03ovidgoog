379. Ali edi: Mercurio is understood.

381. Ithoto: ‘without the dowry, or kingdom‚’ which
had been promised to him—Hymeneus: ‘Hymen’ the son
01 Bacchus and Venus, and the god 01 marriages. This
deity was supposed by the ancients to be present 01 011 101-
tunate marriages; and to shake around him a torch, which
he is represented as always carrying in his hand3 111000
nuptiale, at which he did not attend, were consequently
supposed to be a source of misery.

387. Cephenis: an adjective agreeing with regis. It
seems the party went from the temple to the palace; ‘and
the princes 01 the AEthiopiau monarch go into the splendid
banquet :’ not Cepheni or Cephenum. .

394. Oro: the head 01 Medusa, one 01 the three Gor·
gons, the daughters 01 the sea deities Phorcys or Phorcus,
and Ceto. 01 these sisters Medusa alone was subject to
mortality. As 0 punishment 101 the impurity 01 her con-
duct in her temple, Minerva is said to have changed her
hair into serpents‚ which had 1110 property 01 turning all,
who looked at them, into stone. As soon as Perseus had
attained the ageos manhood‚ he promised Polydecten the
head 01 Medusa as 0 present, and, as is here related by
Ovid, he succeeded in the arduous enterprise 01 obtaining it.

395. Agenorides: This is the right reading; and not
Abantiades, asin some MSS. for Dunhus the ancestor 01
Perseus derived his origin from Agenor.

398. Phoreydos: the Graio, ‘the daughters 01 Phor·
cys‚' and the sisters 01 the Gorgone. The accounts, which
the ancient mythologists have given 01 the Gorgone and
the Graiae, 010 very confused and contradictory. They
appear 10 be 011011 spoken 01 00 the same persons, and the
description, which some poets have given 01 1110 one, is ap-
plied by other poets to the other. lt seems however to
have been the general opinion that the Graiae were only
two in number, and that they had but one eye arrd one
tooth between them, which each 01 them mede use 01 in
her turn. By the assistance 01 the helmet, which he had
received from Pluto, and which rendered him invisible,
Perseus succeeded in obtaining possession 01 their eye,
while they were passing it from the one to the other, and
refused to return ir, till the sisters informed him where he
might lind the habitation 01 thc Gorgona.

399. Bene truditur: ‘while it ’10 passed hom onetotha
other! “
