these and many other dangers, which the enmity of Juno
brought upon him, had been successfully encountered, Her·
eides went ιο Calidori ιο the court of OEneus, hi os AEto·
lia, and became one of the suitors of his daughter janirs,
who had been promised in marriage ιο the hero, who
should overcome his rivale. Achelous alone was wiliiug to
contend with him for the prins, in the contest which ensu-
adr but finding himself inferior ιο his opponent in strength,
he had recourse ιο stratagem, and changed himself, first in·
to a serpent, and then into an ox. While wrestling with
him in the latter shepe, Heroides wrung off one oi his
⁴ horns3 and the loss so filled Achelbiis with shama and hu·
miliation‚ that he submitted ιο his adversary, and was im·
mediately changed into a river. To console him for this
defeat, the horn, which he had lost, was taken up by the
Naiades, and filled by the goddess of Pienty with the fruita
of autumn, and received the name of Cornucopia, or the
Horu of Plenty. Returning srom AEtolia in triumph with
his bride, Hercules was stopped in his course by the swol·
len streame os the Evenus5 and was induced tocommit De·
janira to the care of the centaur Nessus, who engaged to
carry her in sasety to the other side oi the river. No soon·
er however had he arrived with her on the opposite bank,
than he began to abuse his trust, and to treat with oruelty
bis charge. Alarmed by ber eries, Hercirles aimed a poi·
soned arrow at the perfidious centaur, who, wouuded and
dying, gave Dejanira a garment dipped in his blood, which
he pretended had the power os recalling tha affectione oi
her husband, is ever they should become estrangad hom
her. Dejanira received the gist, and aher having been
joined by her husband, accompanied him to the court oi
Geir, king os Trachinia.
