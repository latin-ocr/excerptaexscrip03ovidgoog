Csarsusrv. After the death of Achilles, the arms,
which Vulcau had given him, were claimed by Ajax aud
Idymes, two of the Grecian chiefs. Aiax, the son os Tela-
mon, a king ot* the island of Saldmis, was distinguished as

¹ much by his rashness aud impetuosity‚ as by his invincibie

greater eloqueuce and wisdom in council‚ aad rendered
more essentia! assistance to the Greeks by his advice, than
Ajax by his arms. In the contentiori between these heroes,

os tbe soldier; while in the reply os Ulysses‚ we perceive
