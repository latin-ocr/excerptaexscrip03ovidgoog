Priamus Ovmrus Naso, a celebrated Roman poet, w‘as
born at Sulmo, a town os the Peligni, about sorty years be-
*fore the Christian era. His parents were ot' equestrian
rank, and educated their son sor the bar ; but h'e soon sor-
. sook this and every other pursuit lor the cultivation os poet.
ry, and at length became one ol the most admired and
eminent pcets in the court of Augustus. His prosperity
was, however, of short continuance. Having incurred, by
some unknown offence, the displeasure of the emperor, he
was banished to Tomos, a town near the Euxine sea3
where, after many ineffectual attempta to obtain the pardon
of Augustus, he ended his days, in the eighth year of his
banishment, and the fifty-ninth year of his age. The poet.
ry ol Ovid has long been celebrated lor its variety, sweet·
neas, and elegance. But the frequent violatione of modes·
ty, which disgrace some parts of his writings, detract much
from the meritos this gifted poet. His Metamorphoses,
though not the most finished of his poems, may perhaps be
considered the most curicus and valuable. He has there
preserved the various mythological traditione, which existed
among the ancients, and happily connected thern with each
other. Many of these traditions appear to have been orig.
inally founded on historical facts 3 but it is, in most instau-
ces, impossible* to trace the truths ol history through tue

tales of superstition and the fictious oi poetry,
